<h1>History of Habesha Dress</h1>

<section>
    <h2>Origin</h2>
    <p>The Habesha dress, also known as Habesha Kemis, has been an important part of Ethiopian and Eritrean culture for centuries. 
        Traditionally made from handwoven cotton called shemma, the dress was created by skilled weavers who used simple wooden looms to produce 
        long, soft, white fabric. Early Habesha dresses were usually plain white with delicate woven borders called tibeb, which often represented 
        the wearer’s region or community. The dress has always been worn during special occasions such as holidays, weddings, church ceremonies, and
         cultural celebrations, making it a strong symbol of identity, purity, and tradition
       </p>
<br><br>

    <h2>Modern Influence</h2>
    <p>In recent years, the Habesha dress has evolved while still keeping its cultural roots. Modern designers now experiment with new colors, patterns, bold tibeb designs, and fitted silhouettes.
         Many incorporate contemporary styles such as layered skirts, modern necklines, embroidery, and creative combinations of traditional and modern fabrics. Today, the Habesha dress is popular 
         not only in Ethiopia but around the world, worn proudly at cultural events and showcased by the global Ethiopian diaspora. This blend of tradition and modern innovation helps 
         the Habesha dress stay timeless, stylish, and meaningful to new generations.
